    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I'm Niftalem Tilahun, a web developer and capital markets advisor with a passion for empowering others. By
        leveraging my web development skills,<br> I've built over 10 professional websites and currently teach at a web
        development school. My experience in capital markets allows me to bring a unique perspective to<br> both my
        development and teaching. While some might call it luck, I believe success comes from the strategic combination
        of technical skills and financial knowledge.</p>
